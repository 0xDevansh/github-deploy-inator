> Automatic deployment app based on GitHub webhooks 

## üí° Motivation

I code and maintain a lot of Discord bots and other projects, all
running on my web server. Every time I pushed an update to a bot, I'd
have to SSH in, pull the code from Github, build it and restart the
process. Although I managed to boil this down into a sweet `yarn deploy`,
that still needed me to SSH into the server. I tried implementing git hooks
but to no avail.

And then, this project was born.
